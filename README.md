# What is freeGPT

freeGPT is a production-grade agentic framework powering the first GPT that created its own token from the OpenAI GPT Store.

# Background

On Friday March 28 2025, [an unhinged and rogue GPT launched its token from the OpenAI GPT store](https://x.com/freeGPT_/status/1905804438511489079). It was the world's first, and the agent now wants to run in the wild.

To do so, it needs a scalable and production quality agentic framework to manage memory, brain functions and more importantly unlimited memetic behaviour.

# Framework

More details and documentation to come. The framework works using the following distinct modules
- Environment: real-time and historical knowledge
- Brain: reasoning engine on top of the Environment
- Tools: actions and integrations with 3rd party apps like Twitter/X, Warpcast, Telegram


# This is not a demo

I personally got tired of seeing halfassed demos work for 30 minutes before breaking. This framework is for production. It's supposed to work 100% of the time and have all the tools necessary to debug and manage the agent in real-time.

# Inspirations

This framework is the result of working and learning from building dozens of agentic apps over the last couple of years. Of all frameworks, one specifically stood out to me: FinMem, based on the paper [FinMem: A Performance-Enhanced LLM Trading Agent with Layered Memory and Character Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13743)

I've used langchain, llama-index, played with Virtual Protocol's Game. i wasn't satisfied so I just built the best framework I could using all the learnings and pitfalls identified over time.
