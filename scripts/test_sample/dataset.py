Ukraine Captures Chinese Nationals Fighting For Russia In First Of War
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday announced that
two Chinese nationals fighting in the Russian army have been taken prisoner
from the battlefield in eastern Ukraine.
Zelensky touted proof of their capture, saying that Ukraine's military in the Donetsk region has obtained the captured Chinese nationals' documents, bank cards and personal data.
"We have information that there are
many more Chinese citizens in the occupier’s units than just two
. We are now finding out all the facts," Zelensky said in a statement posted to Telegram. "I have instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to immediately contact Beijing and find out how China is going to react to this."

Subsequently, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha summoned the Chinese government's chargé d’affaires in Ukraine "to condemn this fact and demand an explanation."
Zelensky continued in his statement, "
Russia’s involvement of China in this war in Europe, directly or indirectly, is a clear signal that Putin is going to do anything except end the war
. He is looking for ways to continue fighting."
Kiev has been arguing that Trump's ongoing efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table
are futile
so long as Moscow keeps expanding the fighting. Zelensky urged the United States and Europe to strongly protest the presence of Chinese fighters in Ukraine.
It is as yet unclear whether the alleged captured Chinese nationals are volunteers, mercenaries, or else have actually been integrated into the regular Russian army.
China's President Xi had around the start of the Ukraine war declared a 'no limits' partnership with Putin; however, there's been
no evidence to suggest that Beijing has directly facilitated the movement
of Chinese troops to Russia or Ukraine.
Instead, China has long supplied Russia's military-industrial sector with 'dual purpose' goods which are crucial in the production of military equipment. For this reason Zelensky has in the recent past suggested there's
an 'axis' conspiring against Ukraine
, turning the conflict into a global war. He's also named Iran and North Korea.
The past six months has seen many headlines focused on the presence of North Korean soldiers within the Russian military's ranks, and some have been killed or captured, but the question of Chinese participation remains an open one.
BREAKING: UKRAINIAN FORCES CAPTURE CHINESE SOLDIERS
Zelensky says Chinese troops were caught fighting with Russia, declaring China has now entered the war.
He calls on the US to respond, pushing for WWIII.

President Zelensky posted the above video while also explaining, "
This definitely requires a response. A response from the United States, Europe
, and all those around the world who want peace. The captured Chinese citizens are now in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine."
There has been
some evidence
over the past year suggesting there are indeed at least small numbers Chinese nationals fighting on behalf of Russia. But now it seems Zelensky is touting 'proof' in the form of Chinese POWs. Beijing is unlikely to confirm or deny.

Stellar 10Y Auction Prices At 2nd Highest Stop Through On Record Despite Plunge In Directs
Well, the 10Y auction is in the bag, and after yesterday's very ugly 3Y, today's sale was very solid, at least until one looks a bit deeper.
First, looking at the headline numbers,  we find that the high yield jumped from 4.310% in March to 4.435% today, which is remarkable in itself considering the 10Y was 3.87% on Friday! Still, while the yield was clearly high (and could have been even higher had swap spreads not tightened ever so slightly), it stopped through the 4.465% When Issued by a whopping 3bps. This was tied for the 2nd biggest stop through on record, and the one previous time when we saw a 3bps stop through was in Feb 2023, just as the US banking crisis was raging.
The bid to cover was also solid at 2.665, up from 2.588 and the highest since December.
But it was the internals where the real story was again for the 2nd day in a row. As a reminder, the big story yesterday was that the Directs had collapsed, a clear indicator that there was a funding squeeze taking place in the bond market (as we learned shortly after). And in fact, we warned earlier today that if the Direct award collapses in today's 10Y auction, it could be ugly.
Yesterday's collapse in the 3Y Direct award was the clearest indication there is a funding squeeze.
If we see a plunge in Directs in today's 10Y auction (from 20% to ~7%) all bets are off

April 9, 2025
Sure enough, that's where the punchline was in today's auction because while Indirects soared to a record 87.9%, up from 67.4% and, well, the highest ever,
Directs imploded from 19.51 to just 1.40%, the 3rd lowest on record!
Finally, Dealers were left with 10.7%, modestly lower from 13.1% last month.
Overall, the bond market was delighted with the outcome, and even though
Directs did collapse
, the fact that Foreign buyers are still active and seemingly couldn't get enough of US paper, is the main reason why yields slumped shortly after the auction. This, coupled with the news that Trump was pausing tariffs on virtually everyone except China is why yields have collapsed to session lows after the tariff news.
